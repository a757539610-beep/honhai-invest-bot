# Comprehensive Weight-Loss Mobile & Web Application Plan

## 1. Product Vision and Goals
- Deliver a unified mobile (iOS/Android) and web experience that helps users manage weight-loss journeys that include medication management, nutrition tracking, exercise logging, and personalized metabolic insights.
- Integrate all modules so that data is synchronized in real time across platforms and informs personalized recommendations, alerts, and coaching workflows.
- Ensure regulatory compliance and data privacy, enabling deployment on Google Play and other distribution channels.

## 2. Core Integrated Modules
### 2.1 Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) Drug Management
- **Medication scheduling & reminders:** Configurable injection schedules with push notifications, SMS/email options, and snooze/escalation rules.
- **Side-effect logging:** Structured symptom diary with severity scales, onset timestamps, attachment of photos/notes, and auto-alert thresholds for critical symptoms.
- **Injection site rotation:** Visualization of body map indicating last used sites, rule-based suggestions for next site, and educational content for proper administration.
- **Efficacy tracking:** Correlate dosage history with weight, appetite, glucose, and self-reported satiety metrics. Provide trend charts and physician export reports.

### 2.2 Daily Calorie Intake Tracking
- **AI food photo recognition:** On-device preprocessing and cloud-based inference to detect meals, estimate portion size, and auto-populate macronutrients with confidence scores.
- **Barcode scanning:** Support UPC/EAN codes with lookup against external nutrition APIs and fallback to internal database.
- **Manual entry:** Quick-add templates, custom recipe builder, favorites, and voice entry.
- **Full nutrition breakdown:** Display calories, macros, micronutrients, and flag nutrient imbalances. Sync with BMR module to compare against daily targets.

### 2.3 Personalized Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator
- Collect user profile data (age, sex, height, weight, body fat %), activity levels, and goals (loss/maintenance).
- Use science-backed equations (Mifflin-St Jeor or Katch-McArdle) enhanced with adaptive machine learning adjustments leveraging historical intake vs. weight change data.
- Dynamically update daily calorie targets, macro splits, and medication timing recommendations. Push alerts when user behavior deviates from plan.

### 2.4 Exercise Tracking with GPS & Sensor Data
- Real-time GPS tracking for outdoor activities (running, cycling, walking) with mapping, pace, and elevation data.
- Sensor integration (accelerometer, gyroscope, heart-rate) for indoor workouts, HIIT sessions, and strength training.
- Calorie burn estimation using activity-specific algorithms and wearable integrations (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, Garmin).
- Session summaries linked to calorie intake to produce daily energy balance insights and adjust future recommendations.

## 3. Cross-Module Integration and Data Flows
- Central profile service maintains user data, permissions, and personalization parameters shared by all modules.
- Medication adherence influences BMR adjustments and nutrition recommendations (e.g., appetite suppression windows).
- Exercise logs automatically adjust remaining calorie allowance and hydration reminders.
- Unified analytics engine aggregates data across modules for dashboards, streaks, and predictive coaching.

## 5. Technology Stack Recommendations
| Layer | Technologies | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Mobile | React Native + TypeScript, Expo, Redux Toolkit, React Query | Cross-platform development, offline sync, state management, OTA updates. |
| Web | Next.js (React) + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS | Server-side rendering for performance, shared component library with mobile via design system. |
| Backend | Node.js (NestJS) or Kotlin (Spring Boot) microservices, GraphQL/REST via Apollo Server, gRPC for service-to-service communication | Structured APIs, modularity, and strong typing; gRPC improves internal efficiency. |
| Data | PostgreSQL for transactional data, MongoDB for semi-structured logs, Kafka for event streaming, Redis for caching/session storage, S3-compatible object storage for media | Supports diverse workloads and real-time analytics. |
| AI/ML | Python services (FastAPI) hosting TensorFlow/PyTorch models for food recognition and adaptive BMR adjustments; use Vertex AI or AWS SageMaker for training | Scalable ML infrastructure with MLOps. |
| DevOps | Docker, Kubernetes (GKE/EKS), Terraform, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Datadog/New Relic for monitoring, Sentry for error tracking | Automated deployments, observability, infrastructure-as-code. |

## 7. Compliance Considerations for Google Play Deployment
- **Data Safety Section:** Document all data collected (health, location, personal info), explain usage, storage, sharing, and security practices. Provide in-app privacy policy accessible in settings and Play listing.
- **Permissions Management:** Request only essential permissions (camera, location, sensors). Use runtime permission prompts with clear justifications and fallbacks when denied.
- **Health & Medical Claims:** Include disclaimers that the app is not a substitute for medical advice. Provide links to emergency services and ensure content meets Google Play health content policies.
- **User Data & Consent:** Implement explicit consent flows for processing health data; support data export/deletion (GDPR/CCPA readiness). Use secure transmission (HTTPS/TLS) and encryption at rest.
- **Advertising & Monetization Compliance:** If ads or subscriptions are included, follow Google Play Billing requirements and disclose ad content. Avoid misleading weight-loss claims.
- **Accessibility & Localization:** Meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, support multiple languages, and ensure text-to-speech compatibility.
- **Security & Testing:** Conduct penetration tests, integrate Play Integrity API, use Firebase App Check, and enroll in Google Play App Signing. Maintain incident response plan.
